After seeing the current wage offer $w_t$, the worker either accepts it, in which case the worker leaves the labor market and receives income $y_{t+j} = w_t$ in all future periods, $j=0,1,2,\\ldots$, or rejects it, in which case the worker receives an unemployment benefit $y_t = c\\in[0,B]$, and moves on to the next period to receive a new offer $w_{t+1}$.\n",
